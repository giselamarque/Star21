# Google Books API Search Engine

Functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

## Usage

Users can sign in-sign up/search for their favorite books. Be able to add and/or remove books.

## Future Iterations

Still need to properly define the scheama to structure the API.

## TESTS
